# authTokens
This is about making authentication tokens for my cybersecurity Assignment. 

A full-stack web application for generating and managing authentication tokens, built as part of a Cybersecurity assignment using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and Express.

---

## Overview

authTokens demonstrates secure token-based authentication and the interaction between a React frontend and a Node.js + Express backend. The project includes examples of generating, signing, validating, and storing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and a simple UI for managing tokens. It is intended as an educational assignment for cybersecurity concepts.

Key goals:
- Learn secure token generation and validation (JWT).
- See frontend-backend integration using REST APIs.
- Practice TypeScript, React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and Express.

---

## Features
- Generate JWTs on the backend with configurable secret and expiration.
- Validate tokens in protected endpoints.
- Simple React UI to request and display tokens.
- Example of storing tokens in-memory (replaceable by a database).

---

## Tech stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (utility-first; no custom config included)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Auth: JWT (jsonwebtoken)
- Dev tooling: nodemon for backend hot reload

---

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js 18+
- npm (bundled with Node.js)
- Git (to clone the repository)

## Getting started

Follow these steps to run the project locally. The repository contains two separate packages: `backend` (Express API) and `frontend` (React + Vite). Run them in separate terminals.

1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yumi-2003/authTokens.git
cd authTokens
```

2) Backend setup (Express API)

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the backend directory (copy `.env.example` if present) and add the following values:

````bash
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
MONGO_URI=your_database_connection_string_here  # optional if you add DB storage
````

Important: Replace the placeholder values with strong secrets. Never commit secrets into version control.

Start the backend server in development mode (uses nodemon if configured):

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default the API will be available at: http://localhost:5000

3) Frontend setup (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)

Open a new terminal, then:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default Vite serves the frontend at: http://localhost:5173
The app should connect to the backend API endpoints; adjust the API base URL in the frontend config if needed.

---

## Environment and configuration notes
- JWT_SECRET: Use a long, random string. This is used to sign and verify JWTs.
- PORT: Backend server port (default 5000).
- MONGO_URI: Optional â€” if you add persistence with MongoDB.

Security reminders:
- Do not expose secrets in public repos. Use environment variables and a secret manager for production.
- Use HTTPS in production.
- Set short token expirations and rotate secrets when needed.

---

## Development tips
- The backend and frontend run independently; you can add a proxy or CORS configuration if facing cross-origin issues.
- To add persistence, implement a database service (e.g. MongoDB) and move token/user storage from memory to the DB.
- Add more robust validation and rate-limiting for production readiness.

---

## Contributing
Contributions and improvements are welcome. If you plan to extend this project for production use, please: 
- Add tests for auth flows
- Move secrets to environment or secret management
- Harden endpoints (rate limiting, input validation, logging)
